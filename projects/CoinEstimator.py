# Goal 
#   Create a program that allows the user to input the total weight of each type of coin they have 
#   (pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters), 
#   and then print out how many of each type of wrapper they would need, 
#   how many coins they have, and the estimated total value of all of their money.
#   Weight of each coin and how many fit inside each type of wrapper.
# Subgoals
#   Round all numbers printed out to the nearest whole number.
#   Allow the user to select whether they want to submit the weight in either grams or pounds.
